//DSM: this class represents the DSM layer. It has the following methods:
public class DSM {
	
	private LocalMemory LMem;
	private BroadcastAgent BCA;
	
	public DSM(){
		
		//create virtual memory for the processor
		LMem = new LocalMemory();
		BCA = new BroadcastAgent();
		
	}
	
	//load(x): returns the value of x read from the local memory
	public int load (int i){
		
		//go to local memory and read what's in index i of the array 
		int id = LMem.load(i);
		return(id);
	}
	
	//store(x,v): writes v into x in the local memory and broadcasts a message to all other
	//DSMs to apply the write locally in their replicas
	public void store(int x,int v){
		
		//store into local memory (at index x the value v)
		LMem.store(x, v);
		
		//now contact the BroadcastAgent that the the value has been changed 
		BCA.Broadcast(x, v);
		
	}
	
	public void update(){
		//update the local memory
		int a[] = new int[10]
		a = BCA.receive();
		
	}
