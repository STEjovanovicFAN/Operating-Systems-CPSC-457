//DSM: this class represents the DSM layer. It has the following methods:
public class DSM {
	
	private LocalMemory LMem;
	
	public DSM(){
		
		//create virtual memory for the processor
		LMem = new LocalMemory();
		
		
	}
	
	
	
	
	//load(x): returns the value of x read from the local memory
	public String load (int i){
		
		//go to local memory and read what's in index i of the array 
		String element = LMem.load(i);
		return(element);
	}
	
	//store(x,v): writes v into x in the local memory and broadcasts a message to all other
	//DSMs to apply the write locally in their replicas
/*
	public void store(x,v){
		
	}*/
  }
